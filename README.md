# LinkedIn Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of LinkedIn reviews to better understand user feedback based on their ratings and review content. By leveraging various data analysis techniques, we explore how users perceive the platform and identify key themes from their feedback.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes LinkedIn reviews with the following columns:
- **Review**: The textual feedback provided by users.
- **Rating**: The numerical rating associated with each review, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).

## Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn textblob wordcloud
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   Use Pandas to load the dataset containing LinkedIn reviews.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Examine the distribution of ratings to get an overview of user feedback.
   - Analyze review lengths to assess the level of detail in user feedback.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   Utilize TextBlob to classify reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the sentiment score.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   Visualize the distribution of sentiments and explore their relationship with ratings. Use word clouds to identify commonly used words within each sentiment category.

### Example Usage

Load and run the analysis in a Python environment:

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from textblob import TextBlob
from wordcloud import WordCloud
```

Ensure that the dataset file (`linkedin-reviews.csv`) is in the correct directory path for loading.

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visual analysis of the distribution of ratings.
- Investigation into review lengths to see how they correlate with feedback detail or sentiment.

### Sentiment Classification
- Sentiment classification using TextBlob to label reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

### Word Clouds
- Generation of word clouds for each sentiment category to highlight frequently used words or themes.

## Results

Key insights from the analysis:
- **Ratings Distribution**: Provides an overview of the general sentiment trend.
- **Review Length**: Analyzes the level of detail users include in their feedback.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Shows that low ratings do not always correspond with strongly negative language.
- **Word Clouds**: Visualize common words in Positive, Neutral, and Negative reviews, identifying frequent topics or concerns.
